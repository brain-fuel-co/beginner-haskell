* Hello, World and Beyond!
** First program

We're going to begin with the obligatory "Hello, World!" program. It looks like this.

#+begin_src haskell :tangle hello.hs

main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "Hello, World!"

#+end_src

The first line is the type signature. It shows us that our program is going to involve some sort of input or output. The second line lets us know exactly what that output is going to be. Namely, "Hello, World!"

** Second program

Our second program will be similar, but will give you a personalized greeting. It looks like this. See if you can guess what it does before you run it.

#+begin_src haskell :tangle basic-greeting.hs

main :: IO ()
main = do
  putStrLn "What is your name?"
  name <- getLine
  putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")

#+end_src

** Third program

Our third program will involve making a decision based on input.

#+begin_src haskell :tangle decision-greeting.hs

main = do
  putStrLn "Please enter \"S\" or \"s\" if you want me to be serious\n\
           \Anything else if you want me to be silly. :-)"
  sillyStatus <- getLine
  putStrLn $ greeting sillyStatus
    where
      greeting "S" = greeting "s"
      greeting "s" = "Hello, good sir/ma'am!"
      greeting  _  = "D'oh, wheeeeeeeee! Hi there! Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!"

#+end_src
